# Personal Portfolio

This is my Personal Portfolio that looks great on mobile, tablet and desktop,I will be improving it in the future.
I Created this with HTML and CSS, with the tiniest bit of JavaScript.
It wasn't easy with my skill level yet, so I did look up thing a lot along the way.
I will update everything on the site when my level get better.
